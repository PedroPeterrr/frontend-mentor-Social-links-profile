## Overview

This project is a solution to the Social Links Profile challenge. It’s a great way to sharpen your attention to detail, especially since there’s no Figma design provided. The project includes working with images, links, and spacing — making it a good practice for visually matching the reference layout by eye while reinforcing core HTML and CSS fundamentals.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned more about the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, especially spacing, padding, gap, and using display: flex with flex-direction: column. I’m becoming more familiar with basic CSS concepts and also learning how to adapt and build layouts without relying on a Figma design.

### Continued development

I want to work on more projects to strengthen my fundamental skills, especially in building responsive websites. I also aim to improve my attention to detail when it comes to layout, spacing, and overall design accuracy.
